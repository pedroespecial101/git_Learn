Here is my working code.
I'm so very pleased that it works and want to save this away.

2) Now I'm adding some stuff and yey! it still works

3) I think I will stash this because I want to be sure and I will commit also.

Looks like maybe a 'stash' is an interim measure??

Oh no!!!!  I've just FUCKED The Code and saved it and all!!!!
